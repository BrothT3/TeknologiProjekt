# TeknologiProjekt
2. attempt of a 1 week RTS game project.
Remake of other project as lack of communication lead to problems.
Very bare-bone and not exactly as planned, but (should) live up to the criterias of utilizing threads, shared ressources
and measures to prevent Raceconditions/Dead - Livelocks and starvation.

New (for us) is Threads, Events and Delegates used in this project.
